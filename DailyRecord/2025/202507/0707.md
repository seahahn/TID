## 1. Prevent parent element from scrolling when child element is scrolling

Actually, it was too easy to solve but I couldn't think of it at the time.
So I'm leaving the record here not to forget it in the future.

If you use TailwindCSS, you can just add the class 'overscroll-contain' or 'overscroll-none' to the child element.

If you don't use TailwindCSS, you can just add the style 'overscroll-behavior: contain' or 'overscroll-behavior: none' to the child element.
